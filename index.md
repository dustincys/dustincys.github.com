I am a Ph.D in bioinformatics, studying in school of computer science at [Harbin Institute of Technology][hit], Heilongjiang, China.

As a restless creature, I am very easily bored. 
I seek and try to create the funny things quite often, for example, I developed a [character matrix tool][zifuzi] particularly to amuse my friends on QQ (IM Software), drew a [snake picture][snake] use R at the China lunar new year`s eve (2013, the year of snake), simulated a poker game (named [fishing][fishing]) and analysed its principle.
Anyway, I also did some serious businesses, such as developed an [XeLaTeX dissertation template][template] for postgraduate degree of Northeast Forestry University. 


I dealt with biology and computer science a lot, and I happened to find out a problem which seriously troubles bioinformatics people.
Problem is , biology enlightens bioinfo guys that organisms are dying as time passing by while computer science simultaneously makes them know that code is immortal.
